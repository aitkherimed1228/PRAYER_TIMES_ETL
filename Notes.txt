### Prayer Times Data Engineering Project  

1- Extract Data: Fetch prayer times from the Habous API for different cities and store raw JSON data.  

2- Transform Data: Convert prayer times to a standardized format (24-hour), clean data, and add metadata (city, date).  

3- Load Data: Store processed data in a PostgreSQL/MySQL database with tables for cities, prayer times, and users.  

4- Automation (Airflow): Schedule a daily ETL pipeline to update prayer times automatically.  

5- Real-Time Notifications:  
    - Fetch upcoming prayer times from the database.  
    - Send alerts 10 minutes before prayer via:  
      { Telegram bot , 
      Email notifications ,
      Push notifications (Firebase) }
    - Automate notifications using Airflow (runs every minute).  

6- API & Dashboard:  
   - FastAPI: Create an API to serve prayer times.  
   - Streamlit: Build a web UI for users to select city/date and view prayer times.  

Next Steps: Deploy the system, add a user subscription page, and enhance with more features! 

###Notebook :

Table 1 " cities " : ["city_id","arabic_name","french_name"] * 190 City
Table 2 " prayer_times " : ["id" , "city_id" , "timings"] * 190  up-date every month
Table 3 " prayer_times_details  " : ["Gregorian_date", "hijri_date" , "city" , "fajr" , "sunrise" , "dhuhr" , "asr" , "maghreb" , "ishaa"] * 5700 raws

For the same "city_id" we should have 30 raws (30 days) of PrayerTime data = 30*190 = 5700 raws
